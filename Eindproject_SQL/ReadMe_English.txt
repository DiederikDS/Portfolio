This database was made as the final exam of a SQL course and most of the data is in Dutch.
The database stores recepies for a fictional application where users may add and share these. 
The database was made multiple times according to different 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF nomalisations (see norm1.sql, norm2.sql, and norm3.sql).
"app-schets.pdf" shows a rough design of how to fictional app works.
The different stories are fictional use-cases that were implemented using CRUD.
