# Portfolio
This repository holds projects I did to demonstrate and improve my developping skills

The calculator app was made to demonstrate some basic c#, WPF, and XAML.

Eindproject_SQL is a database that was made in function of a final assignment for an education. It was made to demonstrate database normalisation (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), CRUD, and database design.

Contacts/Application was made to demonstrate basic C#, using NuGetPackages, a lightweight SQL database, a small amount of LINQ, and a custom usr control.
